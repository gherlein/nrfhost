This is a simple programmer for the nRF24LE1 using the Pcduino spi interface. 
And the host app of the nrf24le1 bootloader.

Type "make" to build the source.

Running the program directly (./nrfprog) will dump the InfoPage. Put this some 
where safe, as this contains information unique to your nRF24LE1. Running the
program, but passing a .hex file as a parameter will make the programmer write
the .hex file to the device.

The spi master must support long message ( >64 bytes ).
